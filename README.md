# Replay-Guardian #RollBack Attack Mitigation

This project aims to analyze the RollBack attack against automotive Remote Keyless Entry (RKE) systems and develop effective countermeasures. The RollBack attack allows unauthorized access to vehicles by capturing and replaying RKE signals.

**Background**
RKE systems rely on rolling codes for security. However, the RollBack attack can revert RKE systems to a previous code known to the attacker, enabling unauthorized access.
The attack affects 70% of vehicles, representing a serious security threat.

**Goals**
Understand the technical details of the RollBack attack by reverse-engineering RKE systems.
Build a prototype system to demonstrate and evaluate the attack.
Identify vulnerabilities in RKE system designs.
Develop and test countermeasures to mitigate the RollBack attack.

**Implementation**
Use SDR and microcontroller platforms to reconstruct the attack.
Analyze signals from real RKE fobs through reverse engineering.
Test attack prototype on allowed vehicle models.
Collaborate with manufacturers to uncover root causes.
Evaluate countermeasures like improved encryption and rolling code schemes.

**Outcomes**
Improved security for RKE systems against replay attacks.
Enhanced vehicle access control mechanisms.
Guidance for manufacturers to design more secure RKE systems.

This project will provide valuable insights into automotive security and RKE vulnerabilities while pioneering research into effective countermeasures against the RollBack attack.
